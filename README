This is small modification to add several direct function related to syslog:
  * emergency
  * alert
  * critical
  * error
  * warn
  * log
  * info
  * debug

This way, you can use it with something like below:

console = require('./syslog');
console.log("what's up");
console.debug("something big is going on");
console.info("nothing happened");

Download and build with 
  node-waf configure build

=====================================================
node-syslog is a simple wrapping of syslog for NodeJS.

It may be useful to those who are starting to write NodeJS addons, as it
is a very simple project.
